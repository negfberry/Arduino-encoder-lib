# Arduino-encoder-lib
Arduino rotary encoder control library.

Provides functions to read an encoder (called from a timer interrupt), to set a valid range of values to return, and to return the current value. Works with 12 position encoders, and requires debouncing capacitors on the encoder switches for best results.
